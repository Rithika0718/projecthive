##  Problem Statement

### Background
Modern cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) run thousands of interdependent services. A single failure — a memory leak, a crashed container, a saturated network link — can cascade into an outage affecting thousands of users within minutes. Cloud providers invest heavily in monitoring, but **monitoring is not the same as recovery**.

### Current Challenges
- **Manual coordination** — incidents are triaged by on-call engineers who must correlate alerts, diagnose root cause, and decide on a fix, often at odd hours.
- **Alert fatigue** — a single incident can trigger dozens of overlapping alerts across different subsystems, making it hard to see the actual root cause.
- **Slow recovery** — the gap between "alert fired" and "service restored" is dominated by human investigation time, not by the actual fix.
- **Human dependency** — recovery quality depends on which engineer is on call and how experienced they are with that specific failure mode.

### Gap
Existing observability tools (Prometheus, Datadog, Cloud Monitoring, etc.) are excellent at **detecting** anomalies but stop short of **deciding and acting**. They surface a dashboard full of red numbers and leave the reasoning and the recovery entirely to a human.

### Objective
Build an autonomous AI workforce — a set of specialized, cooperating agents — that can:
1. Detect an incident from live infrastructure metrics.
2. Diagnose the likely root cause.
3. Debate and weigh trade-offs (cost, risk, downtime) between possible recovery strategies.
4. Execute the chosen recovery action.
5. Report a clear, human-readable root-cause summary — all without waking anyone up.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**HIVE Nebula** is a multi-agent orchestration platform that continuously monitors a Google Cloud environment, detects incidents in real time, and lets a team of specialized AI agents collaboratively decide the optimal recovery strategy — then executes that recovery automatically.

Instead of a single model making a black-box decision, HIVE splits reasoning across role-specific agents (Monitoring, Diagnosis, Resource, Cost, Risk, Traffic, Recovery, and Reporting) that **converse with each other** the way a real incident-response team would — proposing actions, raising cost or risk objections, and reaching a consensus — before anything is executed on the infrastructure.

The result is a **living dashboard**: no chatbot box, no manual clicks. You inject a failure, and you watch the agents notice it, argue about the best fix, act on it, and explain what happened afterward.

```
Cloud Metrics → Incident Detection → Agent Debate → Consensus Plan → Automated Recovery → Root-Cause Report
```

**Scope note:** the current prototype targets **Google Cloud** specifically (chosen for its strong native AI/monitoring APIs and to keep the 24-hour build focused). The orchestration engine itself is provider-agnostic — extending it to AWS or Azure is future scope, not a current claim.

## ⭐ Key Features

| Feature | Purpose | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Incident Detection** | Continuously watches cloud metrics (CPU, memory, network, error rates) to flag abnormal behavior. | Catches failures the moment they start, not after users complain. |
| **AI Debate Engine** | Specialized agents independently analyze an incident and argue toward a consensus, instead of one model deciding alone. | Improves decision quality, transparency, and makes the reasoning auditable. |
| **Dependency Analysis** | Maps which services and containers are affected downstream of a failing component. | Prevents recovery actions that fix one thing and silently break another. |
| **Recovery Planning** | Converts the agreed-upon strategy into a concrete, ordered set of recovery actions. | Turns discussion into execution, closing the loop without human intervention. |
| **Root Cause Report** | Automatically generates a plain-language incident summary after recovery. | Gives on-call teams a postmortem instantly, instead of hours of manual log digging. |
| **Live Dashboard** | Real-time visualization of servers, agent conversations, and the recovery timeline. | Makes autonomous behavior visible and demonstrable, not a black box. |

**Component roles:**
- **Incident Detector** — ingests live/simulated metrics and flags anomalies.
- **Shared State** — the common blackboard all agents read from and write to.
- **Agent Layer** — each agent has one job and one voice in the debate; the Planner/Reporter agents synthesize the final decision and summary.
- **Supabase** — durable store for every incident, the agent debate transcript, and the resulting report.
- **Dashboard** — renders servers, live agent messages, and the recovery timeline with zero manual clicks.

## 🔄 Detailed Workflow

1. **Cloud metrics are received** — CPU, memory, network, and error-rate signals stream (or are simulated via a "Inject Chaos" trigger) into the backend.
2. **Monitor Agent detects anomalies** — flags the metric that crossed a threshold (e.g., CPU at 98%).
3. **Dependency Agent identifies impacted services** — maps which downstream containers/services are affected.
4. **Specialized AI agents independently analyze the incident** — Diagnosis, Cost, Risk, and Traffic agents each reason about the situation from their own angle.
5. **Agents debate** — e.g., Resource proposes a new container, Cost flags the hourly price, Risk estimates downtime probability, Traffic proposes shifting load.
6. **Planner Agent reaches a consensus** — weighs the trade-offs raised in the debate and picks one recovery strategy.
7. **Recovery Agent executes the selected strategy** — spins up resources, restarts services, or reroutes traffic as decided.
8. **Reporter Agent generates the incident report** — a root-cause summary written in plain language, stored alongside the full debate transcript.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- **Multi-agent communication** — Coordinating message passing and shared context across seven specialized agents without introducing race conditions or conflicting state writes.
- **Shared memory synchronization** — Ensuring consistent read/write access to the prototype's in-memory state store under concurrent agent execution.
- **Consensus generation** — Designing a debate protocol that allows agents with competing objectives (risk minimization vs. recovery speed) to converge on a single actionable strategy.
- **Cloud telemetry simulation** — Building a realistic Cloud Digital Twin capable of producing believable cascading failure patterns for demonstration purposes.
- **Prompt engineering** — Tuning agent prompts to produce structured, deterministic outputs suitable for programmatic orchestration rather than free-form text.
- **Real-time state updates** — Synchronizing backend state transitions with frontend visualizations without introducing latency or stale renders.
- **Limited development time** — Balancing architectural completeness with the constraints of a fixed build window.

---
